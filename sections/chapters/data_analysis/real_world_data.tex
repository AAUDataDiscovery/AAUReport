In this section we will be exploring data that can be commonly found in the real world.
While there are infinitely many ways to present and store data, understanding common use cases will allow us to tailor
features specifically for more common formats, and will help with creating realistic simulations in our testing.

Finding every type of commonly used data is futile, so we will attempt to approach several sectors that have a heavy
concern with data, and take a high level overview of the datasets they deal with.
