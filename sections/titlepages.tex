}{% the abstract
    Data discovery is a process of collecting and evaluate data from different sources in order to understand trends
    and patterns. The insights obtained during this proceess can be essensial in answering highly important business
    questions, improving the overall business operations, or just to prevent future threats.
    One approach used by multiple business in the world's market is data exploration alongside visual analytics.
    Those are the primarly used methods for searching interesting correlations, trends, patterns, and anomalies that
    could require further investigation. Further on, the results can be used alongside visual analytics tools to
    represent the data on charts or diagrams. Overall, the main goal of Data Discovery is to represent the data in
    such a way that can be easily shared and understand by everyone.
